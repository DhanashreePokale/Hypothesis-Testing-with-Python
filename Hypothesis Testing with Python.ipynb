    "#### reject the null hypothesis when the two populations being compared are identical and the differences observed are due to chance. We reject the null hypothesis by proving that what we observed is unlikely. We do that by calculating the p-value (using a hypothesis test). We generally want p < 0.05 (i.e., thereâ€™s only a 5% chance that two identical distributions could have produced these results)"
